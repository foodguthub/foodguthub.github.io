<p>Fermentation. Some associate it with rot, with decay. But we see beyond. We've seen the benefits it's had on health for the past generations, and we believe in providing that privilege for the generations to come. GutHub is a community of tinkerers and bacteria enthusiasts fermenting our way to better guts. We hope to build some fruitful gut connections and facilitate a community where like-minded people share their passion and discoveries of all-things-fermenting.</p>

<p>GutHub is a social platform for online - offline exchanges of fermentation starter cultures and knowledge related to the practice of fermentation. The Singaporean GutHub community hangs out at (likely-to-be-regular) meetups in <a href="http://hackerspace.sg/">Hackerspace.sg</a> and in the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/guthub/">GutHub Facebook group</a>. </p>

<p>In the Hackerspace, we have a nice <a href="http://github.com/foodguthub/Bank">Fermentation Bank</a> stuffed with starter cultures for free sharing. We also tinker a bit and make our own tools, such as the Mother 0.1. starter culture incubator or the <a href="http://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=zCoDc3SSi24I.korG11Dfhm4A">StarterSwarm map</a>. The <a href="http://github.com/foodguthub">GutHub Github</a> serves as a scrapbook of recipes, tutorials and other things-to-be-forked around the fermentation theory and practice.</p>

<p>We don't stick with any fixed rules, but we have a short <strong>GutHub Manifesto</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Growth - Fork your ferments</li>
<li>2. Sharing - KrautSource everything</li>
<li>3. Abundance - Lust not your neighbours'jars</li>
<li>4. Reciprocity - Give constructive feedback</li>
<li>5. Sustainability - Honour the b2b (bacteria-to-bacteria) community</li>
</ul>

<p>The project is an experiment in HCI (human-computer interaction) performed beyond the anthropocentric limits while promoting a technologically mediated human-to-bacteria interplay. The goal of the GutHub initiative is to test the usability of a peer-sharing economy and open collaboration to support a local DIY food production in Singapore. </p>
